# The-Witcher-Network
In this project, we use selenium to scrape data about characters invoqued in the witcher Books from [Witcher Characters](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Characters_in_the_stories). We use these characters to create a csv with characters in different books.

# Insights
We can use the characters csv to extract insights and compare number of characters in different books.
